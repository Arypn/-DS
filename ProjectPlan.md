# Project Plan: Impact of COVID-19 on the Economy — Home Prices and Earnings

## Overview
The goal of this project is to examine how the COVID-19 pandemic (2019–2023) affected the economy by analyzing changes in real estate prices and earnings. By using the datasets related to housing markets and data on income and education, we aim to uncover the relationship between the pandemic period and economic shifts.

## Research Questions
- How did home prices change during the COVID-19 years (2019–2023) compared to before and after the pandemic?
- Were there noticeable changes in average earnings during this same period?
- Can we identify relationships between shifts in income and housing market trends?

## Team


## Datasets:
### Dataset 1: Real_Estate_Sales_2001-2023_GL.csv

### Dataset 2: SCSU_CDS_2022-23.xlsx




### Timeline:
Finish Plan by 10/14, Combine Dataset by 10/21, finish dataset analysis by 11/5, finish understanding what we analysis by 11/12, write down our findings by 11.19 and our answers to our research question, 11/26 we begin writing our research until the end. Add graphs if we need to when we need it. [NEED TO TALK MORE ABOUT REQUIRMENTS]

## Data 
**Data Collection & Acquisition:** Using two datasets from trustworthy sources (state records and university CDS).  
**Storage & Organization:** Files stored in a structured `/data/raw` and `/data/processed` directory with clear naming conventions.  
 **Extraction & Enrichment:** Transforming dates, adjusting inflation, and normalizing price values.  
 **Data Integration:** Merging datasets by year to align housing and earnings data.  
**Data Cleaning + Quality:** (Not Personally done yet)
**Transparency:** Documenting each step in a Github and including code for replication.  (for the future)
 **Metadata:** Adding dataset descriptions and data dictionary in Markdown.

## Constraints
-Time
- Deciding where the covid ended because even now there are a couple reports of covid
- Limited to Connecticut-based data, so results may not generalize nationally.  
- Some datasets may not provide direct earnings data for the general population.  
- Data may require cleaning for outliers and inconsistent date formats.

## Gaps
- May need to supplement with an additional dataset that directly represents earnings 
- Inflation adjustments may be needed to compare prices over time.  
- Further guidance may be required on integrating educational and real estate data meaningfully.
